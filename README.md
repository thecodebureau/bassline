# ridge


Non-agnostic attempt to bring structure to backbone apps.

## Why Not React or Angular?

Not implying React or Angular are bad. But they are usually
like using a sledge-hammer when all you need is a chisel. If
you are not creating reactive web apps with real-time data syncing,
using React or Angular tends to be over-kill. Ridge is meant for those
inbetween cases, where jQuery or just Backbone is too simple, but React/Angular
is to advanced.
